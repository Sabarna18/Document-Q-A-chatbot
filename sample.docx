Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to autonomous vehicles navigating complex environments, AI applications are becoming an integral part of daily life. However, as these systems grow more advanced, questions about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethical responsibility become increasingly important. Balancing innovation with accountability is crucial to ensure that AI benefits society as a whole without compromising fairness or security.
